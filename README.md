# Password Generator

## Objective
In this repository we were creating code that would create a random password depending on what the user requested. By asking a series of questions to the user and having certain criterias set in place a password would be created by using lower and upper case letters, numbers, and special characters. When the user has answered all the questions and met the criteria then a random password will be generated on the page.
